# TabletKey

A repository containing a kivy-based application designed to take inputs on a
GUI and translate them into keystrokes to pass to another application, and
thus facilitate interacting with applications via a tablet/pen combo.

## Setup

Create and activate a virtual environment for Linux with:
```
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

Then install requirements with:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


## Use

Once TabletKey is running, simply switch to the window you want to use
the program to send inputs to and switch back to TabletKey whenever 
you want to press a button.

It is recommended that you use a hotkey on your tablet to Alt + Tab for 
maximum efficiency.
